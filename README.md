# Uncaught ReferenceError: nonExistentVariable is not defined in Next.js

This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in Next.js applications: runtime errors caused by referencing undefined variables.  The error is subtle because it only manifests during production, not during development.

## Problem

The `about.js` file attempts to access a variable (`nonExistentVariable`) that has not been declared or assigned a value. This leads to an `Uncaught ReferenceError` in the browser's console during runtime.  This type of error can be especially difficult to debug in a larger application.

## Solution

The provided solution in `aboutSolution.js` demonstrates how to mitigate the issue.  Proper error handling and defensive programming practices are essential to prevent unexpected runtime errors.  Additionally, during the development phase of your Next.js application, it is highly recommended to set up your development environment to properly handle uncaught errors and provide detailed stack traces to facilitate debugging, thus enabling developers to address errors that may not be apparent in production.
